# Pipelines (reference)

The YAML files in this folder are the **original Azure DevOps Pipelines** from the previous repo. They are kept for reference only.

**For this GitHub repo**, use the workflows under the repository root:

- **`.github/workflows/lab04-infra-ci.yaml`** – Terraform plan + apply
- **`.github/workflows/lab04-infra-destroy.yaml`** – Terraform destroy

See the main [README](../README.md) section **CI/CD (GitHub Actions)** for required secrets and OIDC setup.
